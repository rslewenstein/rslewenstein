## Hi everyone!
### This is my Github! (Sorry for my english - 🤗)

- ⭐ I'm Rafael. 
- 💻 I am dotnet(dotnet Core) Developer.
- 💻 I am Fullstack / Backend developer. 
- 📚 I'm studying Machine Learning.

So, I'm always learning something. 
I have been working with IT since 2011, I started as a support. Since 2017 I am a programmer (or try to be).
Lately I'm trying to commit more to my github.
